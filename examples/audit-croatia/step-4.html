    <p>After entering the value, press on the magnifying glass next to the <b>'Traži'</b> field. If everything went as
        expected, you should now see some value in the <b>'Katastarski ured'</b> field.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> The value you entered may be a bit different from the one you got back. This is fine as long as the
        value you got back contains at least part of the value you entered.</p>
