    <p>The value you should input into the <b>'Traži'</b> field is either the municipality name:</p>
    <h2>{cadastralMunicipalityName}</h2>
    <p><b>OR</b> the municipality number:</p>
    <h2>{cadastralMunicipalityNumber}</h2>
    <p>but not both at once.</p>
    <p>After entering the value, press on the magnifying glass next to the <b>'Traži'</b> field. If everything went as
        expected, you should now see some value in the <b>'Katastarska općina'</b> field.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> The value you entered may be a bit different from the one you got back. This is fine as long as the
        municipality number matches the requested search value: <b>{cadastralMunicipalityNumber}</b>.</p>
